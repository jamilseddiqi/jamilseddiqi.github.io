The main reason I am studying software engineering is to establish a reliable and sustainable career path. I have a BA degree and an MA degree in two different fields from two different countries plus years of experience in communication, public relations, journalism, simultaneous translation, project management, sales ...etc.

When people usually ask me what is your background? I was like…! I don’t know actually …. I have experience and skills doing this and that. Perhaps I needed to find a very specific path for my professional life. So, finally few months ago I decided to go for software engineering and become a software engineer and focus all my energy and enthusiasm towards this area and become really good at it.

I have always loved the idea of being creative and developing something that can help solve real problems with the help of technology.
